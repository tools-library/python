For some reason, the pip doesn't work at first. For the pip to work
you need to reinstall it via the 'get-pip.py' which can be obtained
in the following url https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Procedures to reinstall the pip:

1 - Open a cmd terminal.

2 - Execute:
         setup.cmd

3 - Download the get-pip.py file and save to the root of this directory.

4 - Execute:
         python get-pip.py --ignore-installed

5 - Follow the installation.

OBS:
     If - after installation - some packages are missing,
     install them using the pip.
